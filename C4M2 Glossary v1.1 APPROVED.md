| Promise       | An object in JavaScript that acts as a placeholder for an asynchronous task which is yet to be completed. It is the object that is returned from an asynchronous method. When you define a promise object in your script, instead of returning a value immediately, it returns a promise. The promise has three states, which are pending, fulfilled, and rejected. |
